# codeHS in a proper IDE

created so that my daughter Syd and others in her
AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) class
https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles/course
could try working on codeHS projects within a proper IDE
and in the process see what it's like to have color coded syntax highlighing,
an actual debugger (beyond print statement debugging),
GitHub integration, etc.

so...

1. load https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. load https://nodejs.org/en/
3. load the VSCode [LiveServer extension by Ritwick Dey](vscode:extension/ritwickdey.LiveServer) (so that your codeHS JS graphics in HTML projects will launch locally in your browser from VSCode)

...then and get after it!
ie.
open the index.html file and 'Run' (w/out the debugger, OR set a breakpoint or 2 in your .js file and run w/the debugger)

eg.
set a breakpoint or 3... eg. lines 22, 25 and 30 of circle_v2.js
maybe add a 'Watch' for 'circles'
Then Run.StartDebugging and when it breaks hover the cursor
over the different variables.
Are you seeing what you expected? or something unanticipated?
Then 'continue' on the VCR buttons up top.
Rinse/repeat.
Enjoy!
