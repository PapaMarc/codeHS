created so that my daughter Syd and other in her class
could try working on codeHS projects within a true IDE
and in the process see what it's like to have color coded syntax highlighing,
and proper debugger beyond print statement debugging,
let alone GitHub integration, etc.

so...
load https://code.visualstudio.com/
load https://nodejs.org/en/
load ritwickdey.LiveServer (so that your codeHS JS graphics in HTML projects will launch locally in your browser)

...and get after it!
